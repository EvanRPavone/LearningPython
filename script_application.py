"""
Save the file anywhere
do ls in terminal to list the contents of the directory
for me its in documents/coding/python/learningpython/script_application.py
in the terminal do python3 script_application.py
This will return Hello there
instead of having python3 in the terminal you actually specify within the file that you'd like to use the Python interpreter to run the code.
to do this you need to add it at the top of your file... #! /usr/bin/env python3
you need permissions to run this file  in the terminal-> chmod 755 script_application.py
in the terminal: ./script_application.py
